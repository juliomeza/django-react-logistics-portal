## Using this Template

To use this project as a starting point for your own application:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:juliomeza/django-react-logistics-orders.git your-project-name
```

2. Move into your project directory:
```bash
cd your-project-name
```

3. Remove the existing git repository and initialize a new one:
```bash
rm -rf .git # On Windows: Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .git
git init
```

4. Remove the previous remote origin (if any):
```bash
git remote remove origin
```

5. Add the new remote repository:
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:your-github-username/your-project-name.git
```

6. Verify the remote repository is correctly set:
```bash
git remote -v
```

7. Make your first commit (optional, if you modified files):
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "First commit"
git branch -M main
```

8. Push the changes to the new repository:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## Backend Setup

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
cd server
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure PostgreSQL database in `settings.py`:

Before proceeding, ensure you have created a PostgreSQL database and a user with appropriate permissions. Avoid using special characters like `@` in the password, as they may cause connection issues.

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'your_database_name',
        'USER': 'your_database_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_secure_password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```

To create a PostgreSQL database and user, you can use the following commands:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;
CREATE USER your_database_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_secure_password';
ALTER ROLE your_database_user SET client_encoding TO 'utf8';
ALTER ROLE your_database_user SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'read committed';
ALTER ROLE your_database_user SET timezone TO 'UTC';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE your_database_name TO your_database_user;
```

4. Run migrations:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

5. Create a superuser:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

6. Create initial Order Statuses:

The following Order Statuses are required for the system to function properly. You can create them through the Django admin interface or by using the database shell:

| ID | Status Name | Description | Lookup Code |
|----|------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | Created | Order initiated, editable | 01_created |
| 2 | Submitted | Order sent, not editable by the user | 02_submitted |
| 3 | Received | Received by the WMS | 03_received |
| 4 | Processing | In preparation process | 04_processing |
| 5 | Shipped | Sent to the carrier | 05_shipped |
| 6 | In Transit | On the way to the destination | 06_in_transit |
| 7 | Delivered | Delivered to the customer | 07_delivered |

You can use the following SQL to insert these statuses:

```sql
INSERT INTO orders_orderstatus (id, status_name, description, lookup_code, created_date, modified_date) VALUES
(1, 'Created', 'Order initiated, editable', '01_created', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP),
(2, 'Submitted', 'Order sent, not editable by the user', '02_submitted', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP),
(3, 'Received', 'Received by the WMS', '03_received', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP),
(4, 'Processing', 'In preparation process', '04_processing', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP),
(5, 'Shipped', 'Sent to the carrier', '05_shipped', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP),
(6, 'In Transit', 'On the way to the destination', '06_in_transit', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP),
(7, 'Delivered', 'Delivered to the customer', '07_delivered', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
```

7. Start the development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

## Frontend Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd client
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## API Endpoints

The backend provides a set of API endpoints for managing different modules. Below are some key API routes:

- **Authentication:**
  - `POST /api/auth/login/` - Login user and return JWT tokens
  - `POST /api/auth/refresh/` - Refresh JWT token
  - `POST /api/auth/logout/` - Logout user and clear tokens

- **Users & Roles:**
  - `GET /api/users/` - List all users
  - `POST /api/users/` - Create a new user
  - `GET /api/roles/` - List available roles

- **Enterprise & Clients:**
  - `GET /api/enterprises/` - List enterprises
  - `GET /api/clients/` - List clients
  - `GET /api/projects/` - List projects

- **Orders & Inventory:**
  - `GET /api/orders/` - List orders
  - `POST /api/orders/` - Create a new order
  - `GET /api/inventories/` - List inventory items
  - `GET /api/materials/` - List materials
  - `GET /api/uoms/` - List units of measure
  - `GET /api/material-types/` - List material types

- **Logistics:**
  - `GET /api/warehouses/` - List warehouses

## API Documentation (Swagger & Redoc)

To explore and test the API endpoints interactively, you can use **Swagger** or **Redoc**.

- **Swagger UI:** Allows you to test API endpoints directly from the interface.  
  ðŸ‘‰ [`http://localhost:8000/swagger/`](http://localhost:8000/swagger/)

- **Redoc:** Provides a well-structured and easy-to-read API documentation view.  
  ðŸ‘‰ [`http://localhost:8000/redoc/`](http://localhost:8000/redoc/)

- **Download Swagger JSON Schema:**  
  ðŸ‘‰ [`http://localhost:8000/swagger.json`](http://localhost:8000/swagger.json) (File will be downloaded)

Swagger is useful for development and testing, while Redoc offers a more structured documentation experience.  
The JSON schema can be used for API documentation, integrations, or importing into tools like Postman or API clients.
